                    <h2>Hello! I'm Shreeyukta Sharma </h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my climate solutions project! I'm a passionate student at Seneca Polytechnic, 
                        currently enrolled in the Computer Programming program. This project represents my 
                        commitment to using technology to address one of the most pressing challenges of our time: 
                        climate change.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>My Interests</h3>

                    <h3>Current Studies</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently taking courses including Web Programming, Database Management, 
                        and Object Oriented Programming. This project combines many of the skills I've learned 
                        in these courses, from Node.js and Express.js to responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking local trails, reading about renewable 
                        energy technologies, or volunteering for environmental organizations in my community. 
                        I believe that small actions can lead to big changes!
                    </p>
